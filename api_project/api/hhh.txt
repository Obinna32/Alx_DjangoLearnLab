curl -X POST -d "username=Obinna32&password=password12345,." http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/api-token-auth/


Step 4: Test Authentication
Create a User:
You need a user to generate a token for. Run:
code
Bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
(Follow the prompts to set a username and password).
Obtain a Token:
Use curl or Postman to send a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/api-token-auth/ with your credentials:
code
Bash
curl -X POST -d "username=YOUR_USER&password=YOUR_PASSWORD" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/api-token-auth/
You will receive a response like: {"token": "9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b"}.
Access Secured Data:
Try to GET the books without a token—it should fail (401 Unauthorized).
Then, try with the token in the header:
code
Bash
curl -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN_VALUE" http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/books/

{"token":"a185c9666d86ae974dff6bacd7eafd99dec4d6ac"}


o fix this, follow these steps:
1. Start the Server
Open a new terminal window (or use the one you were using), ensure you are in the directory where manage.py is located, and run:
code
Bash
python manage.py runserver
Keep this terminal open. You should see output that says:
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Run the curl command again
While the server is running in that first terminal, open a second terminal window to run your curl command:
code
Bash
curl -X POST -d "username=Obinna32&password=password12345,." http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/api-token-auth/
